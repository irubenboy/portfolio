            My name is Rub√©n. I started to program when I was 18 years old. At the moment, <strong>I'm working as computer technician and programmer</strong>
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            Some of my achievements include helping my classmates who struggled the most during my time as a student. This encouraged me to continue doing so to this day, which is why <strong>I help people who are just starting</strong> out in the world of programming.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, one of my strengths is that <strong>I know how to work in a team</strong>, and I always enjoy learning, which is why I consider myself <strong>self-taught</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            As for experience in programming, <strong>I have developed several projects in different languages</strong>, which you can view on this page.
